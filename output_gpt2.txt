Prompt:

hie nie brine kie

Output:

hie nie brine kieren, wenn das Nacht der Welt. The first time I saw the film was in a hotel room at my parents' house on Christmas Eve 2001 when they were visiting their daughter and her sister-in law from Germany who had just graduated college with an MBA degree (she is now working as assistant editor for The New York Times). They are both very young women of about 20 years old – she has been married to one man since January 2011 but he still lives alone because his wife works full time so it's not really possible that we can afford him any more than our children do! So what did you think? What would your family look like if this movie came out?!

Prompt:

hie nie brine kie

Output:

hie nie brine kieren. The first time I saw this, it was a very nice little book that had been sitting on my shelf for years and still has some of the best illustrations in all history! It's just so beautiful to read about how we are able not only survive but thrive as humans because our brains have evolved from being built into living organisms (like us) by evolution itself...and then when you look at what is happening now with animals like elephants or chimpanzees there really isn't much left except one thing: they're going extinct right? Well if your brain doesn' die off after 20 million generations... well maybe next year will be even better than last month :)

Prompt:

ballons! balloons!

Output:

ballons! balloons! The first thing I did was to make a few small balloon designs. The idea is that you can create your own unique design for the game, and then add it into an existing one or two of those games as well (which would be great!). This way if someone wants to play with their favorite characters in another title they could just use this simple concept: "I want my character's name on them." It works really good because when people see how many different things are possible there will always be something interesting going around…and we'll have fun making these little bubbles out of any number from 1-10 like some kinda cute kid who has no clue what he does but knows all about Bubblegum!" So here goes...   Here comes our main hero - his friend Bubbles!! He gets hit by lightning while trying not get hurt so much though..he doesn't know why until after everyone else dies!!! And now let me tell ya guys....we're gonna do more than simply put up stickers/paintings etc., which means adding other stuff too :) We also need help getting rid off bugs such Aspergers & Other Bugs :) If anyone needs assistance please feel free email us at support

Prompt:

ballons! balloons!

Output:

ballons! balloons! I'm not sure if I can say this enough. The first time you see a balloon, it's the most beautiful thing in existence and that is why we are so excited about these new toys for kids to play with on their own or as part of our family activities at home (and even more importantly when they're playing together). We have been working hard over recent months trying out some great ideas from around the world including:  "The World Wide Web", "How To Play With Your Balloon," "What Is A Bubble?" & many others… but none has really hit us yet like what will be coming next year!! So please keep an eye open though because there may still be lots of exciting things ahead!!!

Prompt:

ballons! balloons!

Output:

ballons! balloons! The first thing I did was to make a small balloon that would fit on the top of my head. It's not very big, but it is pretty darn cool and looks like this:  I then made some other smaller ones for myself as well (the one with no wings), so you can see how much fun they are when done right...

boo hoo

Output:

boo hoo, and I'm not going to lie. It's a very good game." - The New York Times   "I think it was the best of times," said Michael Jaffe about his team in Game 6 against Dallas on Sunday night: "[The Stars] were playing with great energy that they had never seen before when you're trying so hard for an extra point or two [in regulation]. They played like we did at home tonight... We got our first goal off one shot from Mattias Janmark (who scored) but then went down just short after he came up behind us..." - ESPN Stats & Information

Prompt:

tiis s

Output:

tiis s.v. "to be born again." The word is derived from the Latin for, and in Greek it means to come back into existence; hence we have a name of this kind: that which comes out after death or resurrection (as if there were no God) has been called by some names like 'the old man' [cf. LXXI]. The meaning here may not seem so much different than what was said before about those who say they are reborn as children but rather more familiar with them because their parents had died at birth.[9] It seems also probable therefore that these people would call themselves Christians even though all other religions do likewise[10]; since many believe Christ came down through his mother's womb while others think he did when she gave him up on account her son became an adult woman,[11][12], although both groups claim otherwise without any evidence whatsoever."[13]"And now I will tell you how my father went away," says Jesus saying unto me:[14]:—"For behold! thou hast seen thy Father coming forth among us!" And then He cried aloud—"Father go ye hither"; wherefore let our fathers take heed lest one day another should pass over thee? For every time Thou
